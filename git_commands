# Adding locally hosted code to GitHub:
If you have existing source code or repositories stored locally on your computer or private network, you can add them to GitHub by typing commands in a terminal. You can do this by typing Git commands directly, or by using GitHub CLI.

GitHub CLI is an open source tool for using GitHub from your computer's line. GitHub CLI can simplify the process of adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line. 
# Adding a local repository to GitHub with GitHub CLI:
1. In CLI, navigate to the root directory of your project.
2. Initialize the local directory as a Git repository
	git init -b main
3. Stage and commit all the files in your project
